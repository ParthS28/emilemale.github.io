## Welcome to FrameBlends Project 

This project is developed by Parth Shukla for Google Summer of Code 2022 with Red Hen Lab

### Project Description 
- A knowledge extraction pipeline for artworks from christian iconography that will be used to create a knowledge graph for Christian Iconography. The intention of knowledge graph is that it should help untutored eyes find connections between different artworks. This project is divided into 4 main parts:
1) A model to find the parts of the image that might be useful to us and extract those regions of interest
2) A classification model that would extract possible classes as well as items and use the confidence scores
3) Defining an ontology that would be the skeleton for our knowledge graph. It would be able to tackle the problem of finding connections between separate artworks using the confidence scores found in the previous step
4) Finally, we would populate our knowledge base with the help of our ontology.

#### Part 1: Completed preparation tasks 



The following small tasks have been completed by Jun 12, Sunday. 

- Understand Red Hen Techne Public Site
- Understand how to create Singularity and other information related to Singularity 
- Connected with Rishab, who has a project in the same domain.
- Learnt about Class Activation Maps(Link to get you started - https://towardsdatascience.com/class-activation-mapping-using-transfer-learning-of-resnet50-e8ca7cfd657e)
- Reading of Comparing CAM Algorithms for the Identification of Salient Image Features in Iconography Artwork Analysis by Nicol√≤ Oreste Pinciroli Vago,Federico Milani, Piero Fraternali and Ricardo da Silva Torres. 
- Reading of A Dataset and a Convolutional Model for Iconography Classification in Paintings which presented a huge dataset on Christian Iconography. 
- Preliminary study of Christian Iconography with focus on the saints presented in the ArtDL dataset. Studying what icons are specific to what saints and if there are common elements to different saints. See [Christia Iconography](https://www.christianiconography.info/). For example, Antony Abbot usually has a bell, Saint Peter has 2 keys in his hand. There are also common icons like Lily is representative of Mother Mary as well as Dominic. Similarly, Sword is common for Barbara and Catherine.

## Coding Period  
### Blog Report 2 
- Coding Period begins  
- Preparation summary before June 13

Before the official coding period, I mainly finished the following preparation works. 
1. Gain a basic understanding of the ArtDL dataset and its classes 
2. Gain a basic understanding of the Christian Iconography 
3. Understanding Class Activation Maps and how they work
4. Decide on CAM algorithm to pursue
5. Literature reading

Some thoughts: 

What, Why and How of the project

What

The purpose of this project is to come up with a pipeline which could imitate Emile Male and act as a learning tool which could help the a beginner just dipping their toes in the ocean of Christian Iconography.

Why

The importance of this pipeline is that it would make Christian Iconography accessible to people who do not have formal education in this field. Especially useful to high-school or college students who do not have a master in this subject guiding them. In the great ocean of Christian Iconography, art pieces are isolated and disconnected, however that is not the intention of the artist. Art is meant to inspired from other pieces of art. I hope to find a way to show that connection in a computational manner.

How

Below, is a high-level Data flow diagonal defining the steps to solve the problem.
