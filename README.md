## Welcome to Emile Male Pipeline

This project is developed by Parth Shukla for Google Summer of Code 2022 with Red Hen Lab

### Project Description 
- A knowledge extraction pipeline for artworks from christian iconography that will be used to create a knowledge graph for Christian Iconography. The intention of knowledge graph is that it should help untutored eyes find connections between different artworks. This project is divided into 4 main parts:
1) A model to find the parts of the image that might be useful to us and extract those regions of interest
2) A classification model that would extract possible classes as well as items and use the confidence scores
3) Defining an ontology that would be the skeleton for our knowledge graph. It would be able to tackle the problem of finding connections between separate artworks using the confidence scores found in the previous step
4) Finally, we would populate our knowledge base with the help of our ontology.

Some thoughts: 

What, Why and How of the project

What

The purpose of this project is to come up with a pipeline which could imitate Emile Male and act as a learning tool which could help the a beginner just dipping their toes in the ocean of Christian Iconography.

Why

The importance of this pipeline is that it would make Christian Iconography accessible to people who do not have formal education in this field. Especially useful to high-school or college students who do not have a master in this subject guiding them. In the great ocean of Christian Iconography, art pieces are isolated and disconnected, however that is not the intention of the artist. Art is meant to inspired from other pieces of art. I hope to find a way to show that connection in a computational manner.

How

Below, is a high-level Data flow diagonal defining the steps to solve the problem.

Implementation:

I found an extremely useful [article](https://medium.com/@stepanulyanin/implementing-grad-cam-in-pytorch-ea0937c31e82) to understand GRAD-CAM. In order to get good results for our CAM methods we need to train our model on a tagged dataset. Luckily, we have a good dataset prepared by Federico Milani and Piero Fraternalli called the ArtDL. It is available on http://www.artdl.org/. I will use this dataset to train my model. Class Activation Maps(CAM) are extremely useful in helping us understand how a model learns features to distinguish between different classes just as our brain does i.e it observes patterns. Prior to CAM methods, deep learning models were broadly considered to be black boxes and we had to accept the results given by it without understanding what was going on under the hood.

The expected output from this module are bunch of heatmaps for all the classes which have a positive prediction score. Then using these heatmaps, we want to retrieve these objects of interest. This can be done in a way similar to the one explained in https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/7/7/106/htm

*The candidate region proposals to use as automatic bounding boxes have been identified with the following heuristic procedure.

- Collect the images on which all the four methods satisfy a minimum quality criterion: for symbol bounding boxes component IoU greater than 0.165 at threshold 0.1 and for whole Saint bounding boxes global IoU greater than 0.24 at threshold 0.05;
- Compute the Grad-CAM class activation map of the selected images and apply the corresponding threshold: 0.1 for symbol bounding boxes and 0.05 for whole Saint bounding boxes;
- Only for symbol boxes: split the class activation maps into connected components. Remove the components whose average activation value is less than half of the average activation value of all components. This step filters out all the foreground pixels with low activation that usually correspond to irrelevant areas;
- For each Iconclass category, draw one bounding box surrounding each component (symbol bounding boxes) and one bounding box surrounding the entire class activation map (whole Saint bounding boxes).*

Even though the method mentioned above is not exactly applicable to my use-case, for example- we do not have ground truth dataset for bounding boxes so we can not use the IoU metric, however it does help me to get an idea about how to go ahead. I recommend checking the Github repository for all the [notebooks](https://github.com/ParthS28/gsoc22-christian-iconography/tree/master/notebooks).

ResNet50 architecture:
![](images/resnet50.png)

If you background information on ResNet, I recommend going through this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-visualizing-resnets-442284831be8). 

Output of layer 3 gives us a 14x14 matrix whereas layer 4 gives us a 7x7. These matrices are then expanded to 224x224 which is superimposed on the original image to visualise output. An observation was that layer 3 would give more number of regions because there are more discontinuous regions whereas layer 4 being smaller would give lesser number of outputs. 

### Blog Report 3

Goals for this week:
1. Utilise HPC to train models
2. Complete the module which can crop out and extract the regions of interest produced by Grad-CAM for different classes

HPC is something completely new to me. HPC provides us with a tremendous amount of computatinal power and it is important to properly undrstand the capabilities of it while also understanding that it is a shared space and you should not cause any inconvenience to fellow participants. I spent sometime reading up on the techne site to better understand how to schedule tasks. There are two ways to access GPUs i.e interactive job and batch job. I was more comfortable using the batch job. To submit batch jobs you need to submit slurm scripts. I have uploaded my slurm scripts in my repository for anyone stuck in the same position as me. Getting my jobs running on the cluster took some time and I was stuck on it for a few days. Thanks to Dr. Peter Uhrig I was able to figure it out on a scheduled call. After that, I trained my model on the cluster.


Object extractor

If I cosider the results after the layer 3 of ResNet50, I get the following 14x14 matrix(truncated image)

![](images/1_6brE_eJIU3WEuPwfM9lVkg.png)

I need to find the connected regions in this matrix. This can be easily solved by applying Depth First Search, similar to "Count the number of island". I also applied a criteria that a cell could only be considered valid if its value was greater than the median of the entire matrix. This would help to ignore foreground pixels.

Intermediate output looks like 

![](images/1_VZt2XxfFtcoqGx_wF9buiA.png)

After getting this, we just need to bound an ‚Äúisland‚Äù in a box. For example, the island 2 would be bounded by a rectangle covering the columns 2‚Äì4 in row 1.

Coordinates for these boxes, once we get, can be easily extrapolated to get the exact pixel location for the object of interest in the image.

For example, Let‚Äôs take an example of Mary

![](images/mary.png)

Output of the module for Mary

### Blog Report 4

Goals for this week
- Putting all of the work done till now together
- Research on EfficientNet as a method for the second module

I compiled all the code and put it al together so that I could run it on the cluster and get the results back on my computer to observe. The data used for this part was test data i.e data previously unseen by the model. 

Difficulties

1. Storing the meta-data for the extracted objects.
2. Nomenclature of the extracted images should be consistent as the they are huge in number(for example, can have 170 regions of interest for all the classes combined, if not more, now considering only the test dataset which is roughly 4000 pieces of art, we could be dealing with storing 170*4000=680,000 images).
3. Not all of these 680,000 images are useful entities, there is a possibility that it may only contain background pixels not representing anything of substance. This problem would be tackled in the next part of our pipeline.
4. The huge amount of images being produced were difficult to work with.

Solutions

1. I stored the metadata in this format for now
![](images/out1.png)

Columns - object_id, item(basically Image name, consistent with ArtDL), associated_class(which is the class for which the object was generated) and actual_class(which is the class it belongs to according to ArtDL).

4. One method to reduce number of images was if I took output for layer 4 instead of layer 3 of my ResNet50 model as it would privide a 7x7 matrix.

So where are we now?

![](images/DFD%20GSOC%20(1).jpg)

And this is how images look like

![](images/extracted_data.png)

In order to make sense of these extracted images, I wanted to train a classifier on a dataset of images of some popular symbols of iconography eg, Baby(for baby jesus),Book,Key,Flowers,Cross,Ointment jar,Arrow,Bird,Sword,Dog. I tried EfficientNet architecture to do so, here is [the notebook](https://github.com/ParthS28/gsoc22-christian-iconography/blob/master/notebooks/EfficientNet_training.ipynb) for it. However, the results were not promising on the extracted objects. My theory behind why it might not be performing well: 1) Training data was not translating well to the testing data maybe because the testing data was way more than training data 2) Curated dataset on which the  model was trained was not good enough 3) Testing data may be too dissimilar to training data.

**Meeting**

Sharing my result and progress on the call, I was adviced to try to focus on Mother Mary and see how the results are. Build in a modular way so that it is possible to expand the pipeline going forward. This change makes sense as well since the dataset I am using has around 60% examples of Mary.

So based on this I modified my approach a little. 

### Blog Report 5

Goals
1. Modify pipeline to accomodate the change mentioned above
2. Re-training ResNet50 from the first module
3. Getting the extracted objects similar to the outputs you see above but with the new model only for MARY

My modified pipeline looked something like this
![](images/DFD%20GSOC%20(2).jpg)

The main change from the previous approach is that, the system first tries to decide if art is of Mary

1. If it is Mary, extracts the object using CAM and stores its instance
2. If it is not Mary, extracts objects using CAM for Mary and stores its instance

But why do we need this change?

Let‚Äôs say we have an image tagged with the label St. Sebastian. However, when the artist was painting this, they were told to also include a Pear in the painting. Pear is an important symbol for Mother Mary as it shows the sweetness of her soul. Artist included this to give associate Mother Mary to the scene depicted in the painting.

Our first module will be able to classify this image as OTHER i.e not related to Mary, however there still are elements to Mary in this, for example the Pear. When we pass this image through our first module. We get the output of a cropped image of the pear with the metadata saying that the pear represents Mother Mary. This information will then need to be ingested into our Knowledge Graph.

Implementation

To implement this, I had to change the way I was passing the training data to model. If the image was of Mary, I was passing the label 0 and if it was any other saint then I would pass the label 1. Training ResNet50 for only a few epochs I was able to achieve ~81 percent testing accuracy. In additon to these changes, I also freeze first two blocks of ResNet50 which showed an increase in performance.

For getting the output this time, I decided to utilise the layer 4 of ResNet because of the reason I mentioned a few pages up, the amount of outputs I got from layer 3 were huge and inpossible to observe and were redundant too.

The metadata file for outputs looks like this
![](images/out7x7.png)

Explanation - First row has the object_id out0_0_0.png, this means it is output of first image in the testing dataset and the current label for it 0(MARY) and it is the first object extracted in this image.

First number - index number in the testing dataset

Second Number - Class number i.e 0 for MARY and 1 for OTHER

Third Number - Counter for number of instances produced for that particular image and class
